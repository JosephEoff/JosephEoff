New tricks for old dogs.

A couple of weeks ago, I needed to make a few pictures of some measurements on my old [Telequipmet D43 oscilloscope.](http://w140.com/tekwiki/wiki/Telequipment_D43)

It's easy enough to make a quick photo with any camera you have at hand, and that's what I did on that occasion.  The pictures I made with my phone were good enough to get the point across, but it wasn't a very appealing solution.  There were reflections in the scope image, and the focus wasn't that great - not to mention being somewhat "twisted" because I didn't hold the phone parallel to the scope tube.

"There's got to be a better way," I thought.

And, [there is.](http://www.fadstoobsessions.com/Downloads-Products/Webcam-Oscilloscope.php)

If your computer runs Windows. 

Mine doesn't.  I mentioned before that my computer runs Linux - [OpenSuse 15.0,](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:15.0) to be exact.

The Webcam Oscilloscope won't run on Linux - at least not on mine.

I tried [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and I tried just starting it under Linux - the Webcam Oscilloscope software is written using .Net, so it was worth a shot since [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) can run .Net programs on Linux.

No go.  It can't access the webcam under Wine, and it's missing some libraries under Mono.

What to do?

Roll your own, obviously.

I like [Python,](https://www.python.org/) and [QT looks nice](https://www.qt.io/) and is free for open source projects.  There's [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) to connect the two, and the [Eric Python IDE](https://eric-ide.python-projects.org/) plays nice with the Qt-Designer for building the GUI.  A camera mount for a webcam was easily made.  That took most of a Saturday but wasn't difficult - it was merely time consuming.

The end result is this:

I'm not quite done, but it is functional.  I have it connected to my old scope, but the software doesn't care what scope it is attached to.

Have you got an analog oscilloscope?  Well then, teach that old dog a new trick!

Time, frequency, and voltage measurements are made using the on screen cursors, and it makes nice, neat pictures of just the display:

The signal shown was generated by one of my other projects - an Arduino Nano programmed as a square wave generator.  32Hz to 1MHz, and accepts commands over a serial port.  But, that's a post for another day, when I finally get around to pushing the code into a [github repository.](https://github.com/JosephEoff)
