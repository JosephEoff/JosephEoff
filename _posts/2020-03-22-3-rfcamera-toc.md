All about my experiments in photographing the invisible.

As I mentioned when I posted the [voltage multiplier table of contents,](2-voltagemultiplier-toc) I've decided I need to organize some of my posts where I have a long series on a single subject.  One of those subjects is the microwave camera/backyard radio telescope I've built and experimented with.

For easy reference, here's a list of all my posts about photographing the invisible:

1. [Photographing the invisible - a camera for microwaves](rfcamera) - Inspired to follow a childhood dream.
2. [Photographing the invisible - the very first steps](2-rfcamera2) - Is this even worth trying?
3. [Photographing the invisible - building the hardware](rfcamera3) - Hardware store stuff - not the electronics.
4. [Photographing the invisible - the interesting hardware](rfcamera4) - Not the hardware store stuff, but the electronics.
5. [Photographing the invisible - software to drive the hardware](rfcamera5) - An Arduino program as firmware.
6. [Photographing the invisible - software to display what the hardware saw](1-rfcamera6) - A work in progress.

As I make further experiments, I'll link the blog posts in here.

If you'd like me to expand on some part of the RF camera or carry out some particular experiment, leave a request in the comment section below.
