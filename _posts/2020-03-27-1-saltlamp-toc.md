All my posts on the salt block lamp.

It looks like I'm going to have several posts on the construction of my salt block lamp, and that they're going to be kind of spread out.

To make it easier to find all the related posts, I've put together this table of contents.

I'll add to it as the lamp progresses.

1. [The Sunday afternoon junkbox LED driver](leddriver) - Whiling away a rainy Sunday afternoon with a block of salt and an LED.
2. [Returning to the salt block lamp](2-saltlampcutting) - Preparing the salt block for mounting and lighting.
3. Making the LED mount and lamp base
