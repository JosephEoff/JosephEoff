An aid for the hard of hearing.

There was a question on the [*Electrical Engineering* StackExchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) recently that I thought was worth a little time and effort.

It has taken me a couple of days to get around to it, but I found time to look at how you can use [Google "Live Transcribe"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.audio.hearing.visualization.accessibility.scribe&hl=en&gl=US) to put "closed captions" on a phone call.

It's going to take a little explaining and organizing to make a simple and robust adapter, so I've put up a table of contents along with the first post.

0. [Transcribing phone calls with Google *Live Transcribe* - A first look](androidtranscribe1) - It ain't rocket science, but it ain't trivial, either.
