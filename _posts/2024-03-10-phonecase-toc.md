A DIY leather sewing project from start to finish.

I've made several projects using my [Adler class 8 sewing machine](adler-toc) with my [custom made Bigfoot motor speed controller,](motorcontrol-toc) but I haven't really written any blog posts about how I did them.  I've mentioned those projects in passing in [other posts,](motorcontrol16) but now it is time to actually carry out and document a full project - from concept to completion.

My wife and I both have repairable [Fairphone 3](https://shop.fairphone.com/shop/category/spare-parts-4?category=4&filters=35-37) smartphones that are in good shape and which I expect to continue using for several more years.  My plan is to make a book style carrying case for my phone as an alternative to the [phone holster I made a few years ago for the Motorola phone](phoneholster) I had at the time and which currently holds my Fairphone. The plan is to make mine first (with all the mistakes) then make a second one for my wife's phone.

This series of posts will start with the concept and proceed through all the steps necessary to make two completed phone cases.  That will include designing the templates (and will include the templates if you'd like to use them) as well as the construction - cutting, gluing, sewing, etc.
