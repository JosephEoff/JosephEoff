All about the "Art Attack" LED voltage booster project.

Some time back, I wrote a post about making a very simple voltage booster to drive a green LED from a single dry cell.  The idea was to demonstrate in the simplest way possible how a voltage booster works, and then explain it in more detail.  One post turned into 5 as I kept adding details.

Here they are all together:

1. [Fun time - A voltage booster so simple a child can build it](voltagebooster) - Electronics - “Art Attack” style.
2. [How the simple voltage booster works](voltagebooster-pt2) - Time to get abstract.
3. [Revisiting the inductor for the simple voltage booster](inductor) - “Missed it by that much.” - Maxwell Smart
4. [One last word about the simple voltage booster](booster-why) - Ulterior motives revealed.
