Taking a Pfaff model K from sad to glad.

The Pfaff model K is a 3/4 size sewing machine - it was intended to be a portable machine, and was usually sold with a hand crank.

The Pfaff model K that I have here was originally in a table with a treadle.  The table is long gone, another victim of the German fad of making gardening tables out of sewing machine tables.

Since I don't have a table or a hand crank for it, my current plan is to make a wooden base and install an electric motor on the hand crank boss.

Follow along as this Pfaff model K progresses from an orphaned piece of junk to a trendy, modern electric sewing machine.
