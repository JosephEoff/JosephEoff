A survey of root beer brands from Missouri to Georgia. 

My wife and I will be on vacation starting next Monday (29 August, 2022. ) We're going to visit my family in Southwest Missouri for a week or so, then drive east to Georgia to visit the woman my wife has been penpals with for over forty years.

Traveling means I won't have time or equipment to fiddle around with electronics or old sewing machines.

Rather than just let the blog slumber for three weeks, I thought I'd combine our trip with my favorite beverage and the blog.

I've lived in Germany for over thirty years now, but I've never developed a taste for beer - despite the innumerable breweries and all the people who tell you how delicious beer is if you just ignore the taste long enough to get used to it.

I've maintained my native taste for root beer.  I drink a lot of Coca Cola because there's (almost) no decent root beer to be had in Germany.  I used to be able to buy A&W root beer at a (somewhat) local gas station, but it closed sometime last year and has been torn down.  I never understood why a gas station no where particularly close to any of the American armed forces posts sold root beer, but they did - until they closed.

The stuff German companies produce and call root beer isn't what I call root beer.  Germans in general don't like root beer.  There's a kind of cough syrup here that (sort of somewhat) tastes a bit like root beer.  Everybody who tries an America root beer says it tastes like cough syrup.  It doesn't, but I can see how they'd think so.  At any rate, nobody wants to drink stuff that reminds them of being sick.  The German made root beer really does taste like cough syrup - absolutely undrinkable.

What I'm going to do is to drink root beer from Missouri to Georgia and keep notes on all the different brands I find.  National brand or local stuff, they'll all go in a table with date, location, a short description, and a photo of the bottle or can (or an advertisement sign for the fountain sodas.)

Since there's a rather drastic shortage of soft drink flavors in Germany as well, I'm going to also keep notes on the various other drinks I find - I haven't had a cream soda in **years.**

One table for root beer, another for random yummy soft drinks.

That flight was canceled and we were rerouted through Houston.  Barg's fountain has a strong vanilla flavor.  Barg's is a national brand.|

Tastes like root beer hard candy - sweeter, and with a stronger taste of root beer than other brands.|

Our current plans are to be in the Springfield, Missouri area from 30 August until 5 September.  From 5 September to about 9 September we'll be traveling from Missouri to Georgia (with stops for sight seeing along the way.)  The rest of time until 15 September will be about an hour's drive north of Atlanta.

If you've got time to visit with an (almost) stranger and talk about electronics, sewing machines, Germany, or root beer, drop me a line in the comments and I'll see if we can arrange a place and time.
