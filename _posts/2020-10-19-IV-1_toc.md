Making a point the hard way.

The [Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/) strikes again.

Due to a disagreement on the EE Stack Exchange about what the current/voltage curve for a particular NPN transistor circuit would look like, I have built a current/voltage (IV) curve tracer for bipolar junction transistors. It has limited scope and capability, but it was good enough for what I needed.

I bashed it together in just a couple of hours, but it looks like describing and justifying all the things I did by "eyeball" is going to be more complicated.  I'm also going to make a nice GUI for it, which will take a bit more time.

1. [Building an IV plotter from an Arduino Nano - Why am I doing this?](iv-1a) - When I'm right, I'm right.
2. [Building an IV plotter from an Arduino Nano - Generating the bias voltage with stone knives and bearskins](iv-2) - Use what you've got.
3. [Building an IV plotter from an Arduino Nano - Measuring current with an Arduino](iv3) - Ohm's law doesn't require a current shunt.
4. Building an IV plotter from an Arduino Nano - Adding it all up
5. Building an IV plotter from an Arduino Nano - A simple Python program to get started
6. Building an IV plotter from an Arduino Nano - Prettying it up
