All about my experiments with [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/).

I've started playing with [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/), and found it useful for some of the things I work on.  This is a collection of posts about learning how to use GNU Radio and making (and using) some tools with it.

1. [Learning about GNU Radio - A GNU Radio Companion flowgraph to measure impedance](gnuradio-impedancetester) - A first (successful) experiment with GNU-Radio.
2. [Learning about GNU Radio - How the impedance tester works](gnuradio-impedancetester-1) - A program doing mostly what computers do best - math.
3. [Learning about GNU Radio - Hooking up the impedance tester](gnuradio-impedancetester-2) - Pretending I don't have a room full of tools and equipment.
4. [Learning about GNU Radio - More functions for the impedance tester](gnuradio-impedancetester-3) - More math and a little more software.
5. [Learning about GNU Radio - Sources of error in the impedance tester](gnuradio-impedancetester-4) - That's got the inductors covered, but what about the capacitors?
