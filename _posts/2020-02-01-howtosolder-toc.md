All the steps it takes to master your soldering iron.

As I promised in my last [post,](howtosolder-intro) here's the table of contents listing all my HowTo posts on hand soldering:

{:start="0"}
0.  [Introduction to the series](howtosolder-intro) - Learn a basic skill for your electronics hobby.
1.  [Vision check](howtosolder-1visioncheck) - You have to see it to solder it.
2.  [Work place](howtosolder-2workplace) - A safe and comfortable place for you and your electronics.
3.  [Tools](howtosolder-3tools) - It only takes a few tools to get the job done.

19. [Flux and lead-free solder](howtosolder-flux) - When supposedly simple tasks turn complicated.

As I complete each post, I'll link them into this table of contents.  I may add other pages, or combine some items and shorten the list.  We'll see how it goes.

Check back periodically and see what's new.

**2020-04-07:** I have finally finished writing up all the things I think are the basic skills you need to use your soldering iron.  As I work on my own projects, I'll keep an eye out for tricky things to solder and how to handle them.  Those will get their own write up.

If there's some particular soldering task you'd like described that isn't covered by an existing HowTo, leave a request in the comments below.
