All the steps it takes to master your soldering iron.

As I promised in my last [post,](howtosolder-intro) here's the table of contents listing all my HowTo posts on hand soldering:

1.  [Vision check](howtosolder-1visioncheck) - You have to see it to solder it.
2.  [Work place](howtosolder-2workplace) - A safe and comfortable place for you and your electronics.
3.  [Tools](howtosolder-3tools) - It only takes a few tools to get the job done.
4.  [Materials](howtosolder-4materials) - The things you'll use up.
5.  [Before you start](howtosolder-5getstarted) - Things you'll always have to do.
6.  [First steps](howtosolder-6firststep) - Things are finally heating up.
7.  [Soldering wires](howtosolder-7solderwire) - Finally getting somewhere.
8.  [Soldering through hole parts](howtosolder-8throughhole) - Some of the most common things you'll solder.
9.  [Removing through hole parts](howtosolder-9throughhole-remove) - Not the way most folks expect.
10. [Using a solder sucker](howtosolder-10soldersucker) - Making good use of a cheap tool.
11. [Soldering simple SMD parts](howtosolder-11soldersmdpassive) - It's easier than through hole parts.
12.  Removing simple SMD parts
13.  Soldering SMD ICs
14.  Removing SMD ICs

As I complete each post, I'll link them into this table of contents.  I may add other pages, or combine some items and shorten the list.  We'll see how it goes.

Check back periodically and see what's new.
