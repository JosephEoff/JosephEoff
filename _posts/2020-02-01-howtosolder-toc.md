All the steps it takes to master your soldering iron.

As I promised in my last [post,](howtosolder-intro) here's the table of contents listing all my HowTo posts on hand soldering:

1.  Eye check
2.  Equipment
3.  Soldering through hole parts
4.  Removing through hole parts
5.  Soldering simple SMD parts
6.  Removing simple SMD parts
7.  Soldering SMD ICs
8.  Removing SMD ICs

As I complete each post, I'll link them into this table of contents.  I may add other pages, or combine some items and shorten the list.  We'll see how it goes.

Check back periodically and see what's new.
