Some instructions and wiring diagrams to make things easier.

<sub>[Building an IV plotter from an Arduino Nano - Table of Contents](iv-1-toc)</sub> 

If anyone is going use Rodriguez, I figure it'll be beginners looking for an easy to build project.  That's kind of Rodriguez's only real advantage - the circuit is simple.

Unfortunately, beginners have trouble with converting schematics to wiring diagrams.  I have an "issue" open on the Rodriguez GitHub page right now from a person who seems to have some trouble getting it wired properly.

To help that person and anyone else who may be interested in Rodriguez, I drew up some breadboard wiring diagrams this afternoon.  I put those diagrams and some instructions in the [Rodriguez wiki.](https://github.com/JosephEoff/Rodriguez/wiki)

I had a look around for programs to make breadboard wiring diagrams, and found [PEBBLE.](https://picaxe.com/software/third-party/pebble/)  I don't know how good it is for complicated things, but it did just fine making the relatively simple wiring diagrams for Rodriguez.

There's not much to tell about making the wiki, it was just a bunch of drawing and writing and making pictures.  Have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/JosephEoff/Rodriguez/wiki) to see the finished product.

The wiring diagrams are mildly interesting:

I couldn't find a way to label the transistor connections inside of PEBBLE, so I used GIMP to add the "EBC" markings.

Someday I'll get around to adding the FET functions, but I **still** haven't gotten around to ordering some FETs.
