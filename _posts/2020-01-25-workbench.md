Making better use of the D43 software.

<sub>[My Telequipment D43 projects - Table of Contents](d43toc)</sub>

I've mentioned my [oscilloscope camera software](https://github.com/JosephEoff/D43) before.  I used it to make all of the oscilloscope images in the [led driver post](https://josepheoff.github.io/posts/leddriver) and the [series of posts I wrote on voltage multipliers.](https://josepheoff.github.io/posts/diode-capacitors-volts)

The software itself works pretty well, but it was a pain to use.  My computer is about two meters from where I work on my workbench.  Making images consisted of running back and forth from the computer to the workbench.

That has come to an end.

I had an old PC laying around with nothing to do, so I bought a new monitor and a swivel arm.  Monitor on the swivel arm above my workbench, and connected to the PC underneath.

Looks like this:

That's a lot more convenient.  I need to make a tray under the tabletop to hold the mouse and keyboard, but for now I just toss them out of the way when using the soldering iron.

Setting it up wasn't that much work, but I took advantage of having to install the software on a second PC to write up how to do it.

[The Digital D43 software now has a wiki](https://github.com/JosephEoff/D43/wiki) explaining how to install and use it.

Those few pages took several hours to write up.  That was the bulk of my Saturday afternoon and evening - with time out to make burritos for supper with my son.

Now that I've got some instructions for the software, I'm going to see if [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/) is interested in running an article about it.  I've just submitted a tip to the website.  Now I'll just wait and see what comes of it...
