All my voltage multiplier experiments listed in one place.

I've been writing a series of posts about [how to solder,](howtosolder-toc) and realized that I have a couple of other rather long series of posts on particular subject.  One series is about my [RF camera](rfcamera) and the other is about voltage multipliers.  I decided to organize those posts with a table of contents like I did for the how to solder posts.

For easy reference, here's a list of all my posts on voltage multipliers:

{:start="0"}
0.  [Diodes and capacitors and volts - Oh, my!](diode-capacitors-volts) - Let’s talk about voltage multipliers.
1.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 1 The Villard voltage doubler](diode-capacitors-volts-pt1) - Start with the simple things.
2.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 2 The Greinacher voltage doubler](diode-capacitors-volts-pt2) - Getting better.
3.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 3 The Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier](diode-capacitors-volts-pt3) - The big league.
4.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 4 More on the Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier](diode-capacitors-volts-pt4) - Why do something that looks like a problem?
5.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 5 Tying it all together](diode-capacitors-volts-pt5) - Haven’t we met before?
6.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 6 Impedance and current in voltage multipliers](diode-capacitors-volts-pt6) - Where did my voltage go?
7.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 7 Impedance of the Cockcroft-Walton voltage multiplier](diode-capacitors-volts-pt7) - That got complicated real quick.
8.  [Voltage multipliers - Part 8 Wrap up](diode-capacitors-volts-pt8) - Enough’s enough.
9.  [A voltage multiplier and a crazy idea](am-multiplier) - Re-modulating the subflexive fasarta.

If I write further posts on voltage multipliers, I'll link them in here.

If there's some aspect of voltage multipliers that I haven't touched but that you'd like to read about, leave a request in the comment section below.
