Replacing simple mechanics with electricity and electronics.


My [Adler class 8 sewing machine]() was built for speed.  It can sew faster than I can handle it when working with light materials.  It is just about manageable when sewing heavier stuff like the leather it was bought to sew, but it does bog down sometimes.  It also can't sew at really low speeds - I need to slow step things when sewing decorations on the leather do-dads I make, and that's just not possible,

If I had the original treadle table that it was installed in when new, it'd be easy - I'd just have to learn to work the treadle at low speed.

The treadle is long gone, though, due to the fad here in Germany of making garden tables out of sewing machine tables.

My Adler has an electric motor and a crummy foot pedal control.

This series of posts is about concepts in motor speed control and designing a controller that meets my needs.
