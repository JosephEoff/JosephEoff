Returning a favor.

I mentioned several months ago that the [Pfaff K](pfaff-k-toc) that I fixed up came with a "price tag" - in return for the being given the Pfaff K, I was to clean up and restore a second machine.

This second machine is a much newer Pfaff 30-31, first cousin to the [Pfaff 30](pfaff30-toc) that I cleaned up last year.  This Pfaff 30-31 is the newest sewing machine I've worked on.  [Its serial number](https://ismacs.net/pfaff/pfaff_manufacture_dates.html) places its date of manufacture in 1949.

This series will be all about all the fun times I have and all the things I discover about this Pfaff 30-31.
