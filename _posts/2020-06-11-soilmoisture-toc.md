A list of all my posts on monitoring soil moisture in a flower garden.

Unlike some of the other projects that just sort of grew on me, I've started this one fully expecting it to run for a long time and that it will produce many blog posts.  With the second post in the series now complete, I've created this table of contents to keep things organized.

Here's a list of the soil moisture monitoring posts to date:

0. [Soil moisture monitoring in a flower garden - A first look](soilmoisture0) - How much is enough, and how do you know?
1. [Soil moisture monitoring in a flower garden - An infrastucture for testing my ideas](soilmoisture-1) - A garden from the inside out - first the servers, then the yard work.
2. [Soil moisture monitoring in a flower garden - A little bit of planning](soilmoisture-2) - What am I doing here, anyhow?
3. [Soil moisture monitoring in a flower garden - Solar power for the monitoring system](soilmoisture-3) - Assembling a few modules.
